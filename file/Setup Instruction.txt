Setup Instruction
Pre Request
JDK 8

Netbeans with Glassfish

Postgresql

Firefox or Chrome

Note:

Download all the latest versions from their official websites.

Make Netbeans run in English mode, we do not want translations for all the menus and technical terms, we need them in English.

Database
Login to postgres, create a database for this application, probably sampledb.

Install all SQL files in folder src/main/setup/database to the sampledb database you just created.

You can use pgAdmin (it comes with Postgres installation) to create database, load SQL files and execute them.

This will create all tables and insert some test data. Of course you need to create tables and then load the *_data.sql files.

Glassfish
1. Start Glassfish
In Netbeans, Services->Servers->GlassFish Server, right click to start.

Or,

Locate your Glassfish's asadmin command, run this to start:

./glassfish4/bin/asadmin restart-domain
The above command is just an example, use your asadmin path instead.

2. Edit Database connection Setting
Edit src/main/setup/glassfish-resources.xml, change database connection info to suit your environment.

Normally Netbeans will try to add this JDBC resource to Glassfish every time the project runs, so you won't need to add it yourself. However things don't always go normal, so keep this command in mind if you see some errors related to database connections:

./glassfish4/bin/asadmin add-resources glassfish-resources.xml
3. Create jdbcRealm
Run this command:

./glassfish4/bin/asadmin create-auth-realm --classname com.sun.enterprise.security.auth.realm.jdbc.JDBCRealm --property jaas-context=jdbcRealm:datasource-jndi=jdbc/sample_db:user-table=account.auth_user:user-name-column=name:password-column=passwd:group-table=account.v_auth_user_group:group-table-user-name-column=user_name:group-name-column=group_name:digest-algorithm=none:digestrealm-password-enc-algorithm=none sampleJdbcRealm
If it throws ClassNotFoundException, then change the

--classname com.sun.enterprise.security.auth.realm.jdbc.JDBCRealm

to

--classname com.sun.enterprise.security.ee.auth.realm.jdbc.JDBCRealm

Note: Keep this command in one line, do not break it to several lines.

Build&Deploy
Open this project in Netbeans, build and run. Netbeans will start Glassfish if it's not started yet.

If everything goes fine, your default browser(Make it Firefox or Chrome, forget all the others if you think you are a programmer.) will be launched and you will see the login page at http://localhost:8080/sampleweb

Login with username ops and password ops. Or username mgr password mgr, which has account management menu option.

After login, if you can see a colorful dashboard page, you are all set.

Sometimes you need to double check the Glassfish setting for this project. Right click this project and select Properties then Run, make sure Server is the Glassfish Server you want.

Normally Netbeans will deploy Postgresql JDBC driver to Glassfish if it hasn't done yet. But sometimes you need to do it yourself. Download Postgresql JDBC driver and copy it to Glassfish folder like this:

cp postgresql-9.2-1002.jdbc4.jar /Applications/NetBeans/glassfish-4.1/glassfish/domains/domain1/lib/
